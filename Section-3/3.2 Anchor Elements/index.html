<!-- 
The <a> (anchor) tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. 
It has several attributes that can be used to customize its behavior:

- href: Specifies the URL of the page the link goes to. This is the most important attribute of the <a> tag.
- target: Specifies where to open the linked document. Possible values include:
    - _self: Opens the linked document in the same frame as it was clicked (this is default).
    - _blank: Opens the linked document in a new window or tab.
    - _parent: Opens the linked document in the parent frame.
    - _top: Opens the linked document in the full body of the window.
- rel: Specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document. Common values include:
    - noopener: Prevents the new page from being able to access the window.opener property and ensures it runs in a separate process.
    - noreferrer: Prevents the browser from sending the HTTP referer header.
    - nofollow: Tells search engines not to follow the link.
- download: Specifies that the target will be downloaded when a user clicks on the hyperlink. The value of the attribute will be the name of the downloaded file.
- hreflang: Specifies the language of the linked document.
- type: Specifies the media type of the linked document.

Example:
<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visit Example</a>
